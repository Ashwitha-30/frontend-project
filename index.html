    <h2>About Karkala</h2>
    <p class="cmn-para">
      Karkala is a historical town located in the Udupi District of Karnataka. 
      Known for its rich cultural heritage, Jain temples, and scenic beauty, it 
      attracts visitors from across the country. Karkala is a small town about 60 km from Mangalore. 
      It was a major center for Jainism during the Maurya and Vijaynagar empire and still holds remains of the architecture of that period in the form of Chaturmukha Baskadi and Bahubali statue. 
      The lake Rama Samudra graces the town amid these architectural marvels and large black rocks add to the beauty of this piece of land, hence the Sanskrit name Karkala.
      It is part of the Tulu Nadu region and has several Hindu temples. St. Lawrence's Church in Attur is also a popular tourist destination.
